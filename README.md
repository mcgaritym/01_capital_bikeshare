The purpose of this project is to use data science tools to analyze Capital Bikeshare usage around Washington, DC before and during the COVID-19 ('coronavirus') pandemic to answer questions. Questions that come to mind include:

What is the total number of rides since 2018?
What are the highest (peak) and lowest (bottom) demand days/months since 2018?
How has total bike shared usage changed before/during COVID-19?
Is the average ride duration shorter, longer, or the same, compared with before COVID-19?
What bikeshare locations have the greatest difference in rides before/during COVID-19? Is there a trend/clustering to these locations?
Can forecasting models predict future demand during COVID-19 and after?
This brief report is separated into 5 parts; Data Input, Data Cleaning/Processing, Data Analysis, Data Forecasting, and Conclusions. See readme file on github [here] (https://github.com/mcgaritym/capital_bikeshare) for additional details.

What is Capital Bikeshare? From the company site:

Capital Bikeshare is metro DC's bikeshare service, with 4,500 bikes and 500+ stations across 7 jurisdictions: Washington, DC.; Arlington, VA; Alexandria, VA; Montgomery, MD; Prince George's County, MD; Fairfax County, VA; and the City of Falls Church, VA. Designed for quick trips with convenience in mind, itâ€™s a fun and affordable way to get around.

Note: The pandemic begin date for this analysis is considered to be 1 Mar 2020, since that is close to when most cities/towns started enacting protective measures. Since it is ongoing the end date is TBD, however, data is only available through 28 Feb 2021 at this time.
